# Unsupervised Approach for Thermal Image Super-Resolution domain

A transfer domain strategy, from a low-resolution image to a high-resolution domain is presented using a CycleGAN architecture, with a ResNet as an encoder in the generator with an attention module after the encoder stage. The proposed approach is trained with a large dataset acquired using three thermal cameras at different resolutions.
